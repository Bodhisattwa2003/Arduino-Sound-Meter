# Arduino-Sound-Meter

This piece of code uses an Arduino Module, an Audio- Input Device, and a display (Specifically a computer, so as to inject both the code and display the graphing)

The idea behind this project is to monitor the sound levels in an environment, and then graph it with respect to time domain.

Ps. The decible system is not linear to intensity rather it is logarithmic. Thus increase in the decible scale by 10 db implies the loudness pf the sound experienced an increase in intensity by 10 times. ie the sound was 10 times louder
